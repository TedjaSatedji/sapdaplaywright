```

### 2️⃣ Add Your Credentials

You can set up users in three ways:  

#### **A. Manual Method**
1. Create a `.env` file in the project root.  
2. Add credentials for each user (increment numbers):  
   ```env
   SPADA_USERNAME_1=your_username
   SPADA_PASSWORD_1=your_password
   TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID_1=your_telegram_chat_id
   DISCORD_USER_ID_1=your_discord_user_id
   SCHEDULE_FILE_1=schedules/schedule_1.csv
   ```
3. Add bot tokens (once only):  
   ```env
   TELEGRAM_TOKEN=your_telegram_bot_token
   DISCORD_TOKEN=your_discord_bot_token
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
   ```

---

#### **B. Telegram Bot Method**
1. [Create a Telegram bot](https://core.telegram.org/bots#6-botfather).  
2. Add `TELEGRAM_TOKEN` and `GEMINI_API_KEY` to `.env`.  
3. Run the bot:
   ```sh
   python telegbot.py
   ```
4. Use these commands inside Telegram:  
   - `/setup` → link SPADA credentials  
   - `/schedule` → upload/view/delete schedule (Gemini can parse from image 📸)  
   - `/me`, `/delete`, `/cancel` as needed  

---

#### **C. Discord Bot Method**
1. [Create a Discord bot](https://discord.com/developers/applications).  
2. Add `DISCORD_TOKEN` and `GEMINI_API_KEY` to `.env`.  
3. Run the bot:
   ```sh
   python discordbot.py
   ```
4. Use these commands in Discord:  
   - `/setup` → link SPADA credentials  
   - `/schedule` → upload/view/delete schedule (Gemini can parse from image 📸)  
   - `/me`, `/delete`, `/cancel` as needed  

---

## 📅 Adding Your Schedule

You can:  
- 🖼 Upload a schedule **image** via bot → Gemini extracts CSV automatically.
